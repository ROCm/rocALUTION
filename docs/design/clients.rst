Unit Tests
==========
Multiple unit tests are available to test for bad arguments, invalid parameters and solver and preconditioner functionality.
The unit tests are based on google test.
The tests cover a variety of different solver, preconditioning and matrix format combinations and can be performed on all available backends.
